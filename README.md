# Data-science-job-salaries
This Repositary details a **Data Science Job Salaries project**, using **ML, Python, SQL, and Excel**. It covers the entire process: **problem definition, data cleaning (607 entries), EDA, financial modeling (Linear Regression), and visualization** of salary trends by experience, company size, and job type (remote/onsite).
A comprehensive README for this project, based on the steps and insights provided in the PDF, will help users understand the analysis and replicate the work.

Data Science Job Salaries Analysis
Project Overview
This project involves a detailed analysis and predictive modeling of a global dataset of Data Science job salaries. The objective is to uncover key trends and identify factors that drive salary levels in the data science industry. The analysis follows a standard data science pipeline, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling using Linear Regression.





The project's domain is Finance/Data Analysis, and it is classified as an intermediate difficulty level.

üíª Project Steps
The analysis was performed following these steps:


Problem Definition: Analyze and model data science job salaries to uncover trends and predict salaries based on job factors.


Data Loading and Understanding: Loading the CSV dataset, inspecting the structure, and checking data types .



Data Cleaning: Handling duplicates, removing unnecessary columns (Unnamed: 0, salary, salary_currency), and standardizing abbreviations for categorical variables (experience_level, employment_type, company_size, remote_ratio/job_type) .


Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables and creating derived features like salary_ratio (salary/salary_in_usd) .


Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Calculating summary statistics, analyzing salary distribution (histograms), and visualizing relationships between salary and categorical features (boxplots, violin plots, and correlation heatmaps) .


Financial Modeling (Prediction): Training a Linear Regression model to predict salary_in_usd using features like experience level and job type .



Data Visualization for Insights: Creating an interactive dashboard using Streamlit to visualize salary trends and filtering options .
